# Discover Archives Web Accessibility

Discover Archives web accessibility testing and improvements are ongoing. Contact [discoverarchives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:discoverarchives@library.utoronto.ca) if you need support.

Please note that any AtoM-related web accessibility improvements should be submitted to the public release of AtoM via Artefactual Systems for sustainability and maintenance issues.

U of T staff should refer to [internal Discover Archives documentation](https://connect.library.utoronto.ca/DA/Discover%20Archives%20Policies%20and%20Procedures/Discover%20Archives%20Accessibility/#) for access to a web accessible finding aid template, checklist, and information about the "Generate PDF" feature in AtoM. 

PDF legacy finding aid remediation is ongoing across Discover Archives repositories. 
 
Additional public documentation around web accessibility as it relates to AtoM and Discover Archives will be added to this page in the future.
