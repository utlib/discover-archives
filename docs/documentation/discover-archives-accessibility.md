# Discover Archives Web Accessibility

Discover Archives web accessibility testing and improvements are ongoing. Contact discoverarchives@library.utoronto.ca if you need support.

Please note that any AtoM-related web accessibility improvements should be submitted to the public release of AtoM via Artefactual Systems for sustainability and maintenance issues.

PDF finding aid remediation is ongoing across Discover Archives repositories. 

Staff should refer to internal Discover Archives documentation for a web accessible finding aid template and checklist.
