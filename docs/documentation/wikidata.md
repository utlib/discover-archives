# Wikidata

Public documentation about Discover Archives and Wikidata work flows will be added to this page in the future. 

U of T staff should refer to [internal Discover Archives documentation](https://connect.library.utoronto.ca/DA/Discover%20Archives%20Technical%20Documentation/Discover%20Archives%20and%20Wikidata/) for access to information and suggested workflows about Discover Archives and Wikidata/Wikipedia. 

Information is also publically available in the [U of T Libraries Discover Archives WikiProject](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_University_of_Toronto_Libraries/Discover_Archives).
