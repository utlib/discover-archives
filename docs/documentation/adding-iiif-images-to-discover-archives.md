# Adding IIIF Images to Discover Archives

Public documentation about Discover Archives and IIIF work flows will be added to this page in the future.

U of T staff should refer to [internal Discover Archives documentation](https://connect.library.utoronto.ca/DA/Discover%20Archives%20Technical%20Documentation/Adding%20IIIF%20Images%20to%20Discover%20Archives/) for access to information and suggested workflows about Discover Archives and IIIF via Collections U of T and the Internet Archive.
