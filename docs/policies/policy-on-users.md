# Policy on Users
> Created by Karen Suurtamm, last modified by Kelli Babcock on Dec 05, 2025

## User types and permissions
1. See AtoM documentation for default user roles and permissions: [https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/latest/user-manual/getting-started/getting-started/#user-roles](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/latest/user-manual/getting-started/getting-started/#user-roles)

2. Each archival institution will have only 1 administrator user
   * [See AtoM documentation for creating and managing users](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/latest/user-manual/administer/manage-user-accounts/)[](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/latest/user-manual/administer/manage-user-accounts/)

   * If more than 1 administrator user is required by the institution, the addition of more administrators must be discussed with the DASC

   * Each archival institution administrator is responsible for creating and maintaining users for their institution

   * Usernames will be created using the following conventions: REPOSITORY - lastnamefirstnameinitial - i.e. ITS - babcockk

3. Each archival institution can have 1 or more user groups
   * [See AtoM documentation for creating and managing user groups](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/latest/user-manual/administer/manage-user-accounts/)

   * Each archival institution administrator is responsible for creating and managing user groups for their institution

   * Each archival institution administrator is responsible for placing their users in the correct user group. **As of AtoM version 2.10.x: do not add both a repository "editor" user group in addition to the "administrator" user group. Doing so will result in an error when logged in (see DA-2030 ticket for additional details). Use one or the other.**
   
   * Each user group will be named with InstitutionLabel Function - i.e. UTARMS Editor
