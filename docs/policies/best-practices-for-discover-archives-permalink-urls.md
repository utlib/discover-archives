# Best Practices for Discover Archives Permalink URLs

> Created by Kelli Babcock, last modified on Feb 12, 2020

**All archivists and archives staff will create meaningful permalinks for top-level and series-level descriptions by manually editing the URL for these levels of descriptions.**

This will ensure the integrity of the permalinks in Discover Archives by providing meaningful, unique URLs that are intended to be maintained in perpetuity.

Please do not change a URL for top level and series level descriptions - Discover Archives URLs are intended to be permanent.

If you do change a URL and require a re-direct from the old URL to the new one, please email [discoverarchives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:discoverarchives@library.utoronto.ca) for ITS assistance (note: URL redirects are not intended as a solution for frequent URL changes).

## Background information

For more information on changing URLs, see: [https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/latest/user-manual/add-edit-content/archival-descriptions/#rename-the-title-or-slug-of-an-archival-description](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/latest/user-manual/add-edit-content/archival-descriptions/#rename-the-title-or-slug-of-an-archival-description)
