# Remove containers from archival description  

> Created by Emily Sommers, last modified on Aug 14, 2023

There are two ways to remove containers - a) [manually](#a-manually-unlink) or b) [in bulk via CSV](#b-remove-in-bulk-via-csv)

## A. Manually unlink

Starting from the **Browse Physical Storage page** (![](img/200377644.png) Manage > Physical Storage), click on the name of the container you wish to delete, then delete

Or from the archival description page, click on the name of the container you wish to delete (must be logged in), then delete

## B. Remove in bulk via CSV

1. Select the descriptions you want to update, add them to the clipboard, and export them

2. Open the CSV in a spreadsheet application

3. Remove the columns you don't intend to change - just make sure you keep and DO NOT CHANGE the **legacyId** column

4. Remove the values from the **physicalObjectName**, **physicalObjectLocation**, **physicalObjectType** columns and save.
5. File a ticket with ITS - email [discoverarchives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:discoverarchives@library.utoronto.ca)
    * Attach csv spreadsheet
    
    * Ask to have your csv file imported through the command line using the **match-and-update** option, along with the **--roundtrip** and **\--skip-unmatched** optionsÂ  ([see GoogleGroup discussion thread about bulk updating descriptions](https://groups.google.com/g/ica-atom-users/c/daGpYCj9GAE/m/o3Q1qxGrCgAJ))

6.  If the update was successful, follow-up and ask ITS to run the [command-line task of deleting unlinked physical objects](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/latest/admin-manual/maintenance/cli-tools/#delete-unlinked-physical-object-locations):

    *   After un-linking containers in bulk, they will still remain in the physical storage module

        *   Rather than deleting them manually 1 by 1, they can be removed in bulk through the command-line.
