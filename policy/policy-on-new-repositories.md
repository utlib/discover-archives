# Policy on New Repositories

> Created by Amanda Tome, last modified by Rebekah Bedard on Jun 19, 2023

## A. Procedures and requirements for participation  

1. *Discover Archives* is intended for UTL libraries and archives holding archival material that requires hierarchical archival description.  
    
2. To join *Discover Archives*, repositories must have a staff member familiar with RAD or ISAD(G) and have staff time to contribute and attend the *Discover Archives* Steering Committee meetings.  
    
3. Repositories wishing to participate in *Discover Archives* should notify the Steering Committee (via [discoverarchives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:discoverarchives@library.utoronto.ca)) and the Steering Committee will decide when/if the repository will be added, on a case-by-case basis.

## B. Training for new repositories

1. When new repositories join Discover Archives, they should:  
    * Meet with a DASC member for an introduction to Discover Archives, the documentation, reporting technical issues to ITS, and the listserv;
    
    * Review policies and documentation;
    
    * Add an institutional record into the production and development instances of Discover Archives;
    
    * Set up user accounts for their staff (see [policy on users](/discover-archives/policy/policy-on-users));
    
    * Identify an individual to join DASC.
