# Policy on Subject, Space, Place Names, and Function Headings

> Created by Amanda Tome, last modified by Kelli Babcock on Mar 07, 2023

_**Policy under review.**_
{: .label .label-red }

Repositories should not use subject, place, or function access points at this point in time. St. Michael's College Archival & Manuscript Collections is the exception to this rule, as their original descriptions already included subject headings. The *Discover Archives* help page/user guide should make it clear that subject headings are only being used by that one repository.

* Names can be added as subject access points at any level of description.

As a result of a February 2020 iSchool UX survey, and timing with the PCC Wikidata Pilot project, a group of Discover Archives archivists and ITS explored how to apply access points in Discover Archives. The resulting research was published in 2022:
