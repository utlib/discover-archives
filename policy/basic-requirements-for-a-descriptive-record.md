### FONDS/COLLECTION LEVEL

Record the unique identifier for the fonds or collection being described. The country code and repository code are automatically populated by the system. The three components (country code, repository code and unique identifier) form the reference code of the fonds or collection. Example:

**Note:** If the next level of description includes a unique reference code then a unique codes is not required at the fonds/collection level.

**Date(s) (3.1.3) / Date(s) of Creation (.4B)**

Select the unit of description from the drop down list provided.
