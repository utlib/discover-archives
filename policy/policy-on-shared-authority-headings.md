# Policy on Shared Authority Headings  
> Created by Amanda Tome, last modified by Rebekah Bedard on Jun 19, 2023

* All repositories wishing to use [name authorities](https://discoverarchives.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/actor/browse) as access points are asked to verify that the name authority does not already exist before creating a new heading.

* Where more than one repository holds records by/about a creator, those repositories must share an authority record.

* The repositories should work together to create a biographical sketch/administrative history that satisfies all parties. 

* The institution identifier should list all institutions that worked to create the record.
    * Example: [John A. Sawyer](https://discoverarchives.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/sawyer-john)
